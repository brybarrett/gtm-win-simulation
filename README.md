A cinematic, interactive case-study that walks you through the exact AI-powered playbook I used to land **$4.5 M in new revenue in Q1 ’25**.

## Why This Exists
Recruiters, founders, and RevOps leaders keep asking *“Show me the proof.”*  
So I built one screen that **shows + tells** in under 30 seconds.

## Highlights
- GPT-driven lead qualification  
- Zapier + Notion pipeline orchestration  
- Slack executive trigger loop  
- 90-day close timeline with zero churn risk
